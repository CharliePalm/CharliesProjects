# CharliesProjects
This is a relic from when I was in college and wanted personal projects to beef up my resume. I've decided to leave it here as a fun way to look back. (Especially at the Secret Hitler. Young Charlie knew NOTHING about wed development back then lol)

An attempt at bringing the popular tabletop game Secret Hitler to the web through node.JS (Currently undergoing rehaul)

A python data generation tool based on given constraints

A python webscraper that takes a list of french verbs and conjugates them and includes a definiton to store in a json file

A chess AI that is ALMOST able to actually play chess through a deeply linked neural network



In the future:
Create a tool for practicing verb conjugations
Improve AI; implement A* search in addition to neural network
Finish niche Secret Hitler endgames
