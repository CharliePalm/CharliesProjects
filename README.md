# CharliesProjects
A series of projects that I've been working on including:

An attempt at bringing the popular tabletop game Secret Hitler to the web through node.JS (Currently undergoing rehaul)

A python data generation tool based on given constraints

A python webscraper that takes a list of french verbs and conjugates them and includes a definiton to store in a json file

A chess AI that is ALMOST able to actually play chess through a deeply linked neural network



In the future:
Create a tool for practicing verb conjugations
Improve AI; implement A* search in addition to neural network
Finish niche Secret Hitler endgames
